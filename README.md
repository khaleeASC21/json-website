# json_project

## Instructions
1. Go to https://randomuser.me/api/?results=5

   - We put the number of users we want after the "=" in the URL

2. Make a request for anywhere between 10 and 30 users

3. Copy ALL of the JSON (`Ctrl + A` then `Ctrl + C`) and paste it into the “database.js” file storing it into a variable called `profiles`

4. Using everything you know about creating and designing websites, the DOM, events, and objects, you will create a single web page that displays the JSON data in any way you see fit

   - Use our code along from earlier as reference if you are having trouble starting :)

5. Before you begin…

   - Wireframe your concept
     - Consider the following:
       - What information do you want to display? Some of it? All of it?
       - You can go to https://randomuser.me/ and see an example of visualizing one user
       - How would you visualize 10+ users?
       - The urls for the pictures work, so feel free to use them!
     - Once done, present your wireframe to your instructional team for approval.
       - If your wireframe is not approved, make any necessary revisions and try again.
   - Once approved, you may begin creating!
